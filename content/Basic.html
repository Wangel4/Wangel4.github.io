<p>Beta burger to me is the best burger resturant, they make amazing burgers and the fries are pretty good too with the perfect amount of salt, not too much but not too little.</p>
<p> I don't know what sauce they put on their burgers but is is so tasty it makes the burger that much better. Lastly i walk past them on my way home so i could easily</p>
<p>get some Beta Burger if I wanted, while going home.</p>

<p>Ihop is such a good resturant I don't go there much but when I do I get to eat the best breakfast ever. The pancakes there are legendary and so is everything else.</p>
